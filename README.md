# Pamwe Foundation Project

## Background
The Pamwe Foundation is a platform that will enable members of a community to work together to solve problems that the city councils and government have failed to address effectively due to poor communication with citizens. “Pamwe” derives from the Shona word, “Pamwe-Chete”, meaning “community and togetherness”. Communities become powerful when they work together, as exemplified by farming endeavors, retail cooperatives, and community art. 

Cities across Zimbabwe have poor infrastructure due to the growing populations, and this problem is worsened by a lack of governmental intervention in maintaining the existing infrastructure. While this problem causes road traffic accidents, poses health risks and crime, it has not arisen due to shortcomings in the government’s budget for infrastructure, but rather,a lack of awareness about where these problems are occurring on roads, water pipes, and traffic lights. The  cost for city councils to carry out paper-based field surveys of the city to identify all areas in need of repair is too high to justify. Meanwhile, city councils use paper filing systems that thwart effective interdepartmental communication of information, and this makes decision-making slow and repair turnover very low.
